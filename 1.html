    <p>There are 264 and 214 electoral votes each for Joe Biden and incumbent Donald Trump from the states already called the election for the candidates. </p>
    <p>The swing states of Nevada and Georgia have been reporting 87% and 99% each out of the entire votes including mail-in ballots, with which Joe Biden is leading the race by about 13,000 and 3,000 votes each at the moment. </p>
    <p>The swing state of North Carolina has called the election for Donald Trump, in which he wins by about 80,000 votes.
    <p>As both of the candidates are expected to get <strong>286 and 229 electoral votes</strong> each for themselves, the president-elect is likely going to be Joe Biden at the great chance.
